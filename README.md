# Deep Learning for Medicine

There are two directories in this repository:

  * AI for medical diagnosis
  * AI for medical prognosis

`AI for medical diagnosis` This is my attempt to learn to find tumors and lesion in the brain using Deep Learning Neural Network. Doctors cannot operate for brain tumor removal unless they know exactly where the tumor is located. It becomes particularly important to know the location of lesions for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Knowledge of location helps doctors to track disease progression and to determine if the treatment is working. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images can be used to image the brain in 3D but a highly specilized doctor still has to review the resulting images and manually mask the affected volume. This is a difficult and time consuming task. Machine Learning algorithms that could at least partially automate the process would be very valuable. These large datasets are currently lacking but are much needed for medical research.

While `AI for medical diagnosis` shows how to deploy Machine Learning models for predicting survival/hazards for patients. Diagram below shows Harrel's C-index that displays accuracy of our models to predict survival rate between any two randomly selected patients based on their risk score.
